# DoubleEntryPoint

_powered by [Forta](https://forta.org/)_

_Difficulty 4/10_

This level features a `CryptoVault` with special functionality, the `sweepToken` function. This is a common function to retrieve tokens stuck in a contract. The `CryptoVault` operates with an `underlying` token that can't be swept, being it an important core's logic component of the `CryptoVault`, any other token can be swept.

The underlying token is an instance of the DET token implemented in `DoubleEntryPoint` contract definition and the `CryptoVault` holds 100 units of it. Additionally the `CryptoVault` also holds 100 of `LegacyToken LGT`.

In this level you should figure out where the bug is in `CryptoVault` and protect it from being drained out of tokens.

The contract features a `Forta` contract where any user can register its own `detection bot` contract. Forta is a decentralized, community-based monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems as quickly as possible. Your job is to implement a `detection bot` and register it in the `Forta` contract. The bot's implementation will need to raise correct alerts to prevent potential attacks or bug exploits.

Congratulations!

This is the first experience you have with a [Forta bot](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/).

Forta comprises a decentralized network of independent node operators who scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.

The presented example is just for educational purpose since Forta bot is not modeled into smart contracts. In Forta, a bot is a code script to detect specific conditions or events, but when an alert is emitted it does not trigger automatic actions - at least not yet. In this level, the bot's alert effectively trigger a revert in the transaction, deviating from the intended Forta's bot design.

Detection bots heavily depends on contract's final implementations and some might be upgradeable and break bot's integrations, but to mitigate that you can even create a specific bot to look for contract upgrades and react to it. Learn how to do it [here](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/quickstart/).

You have also passed through a recent security issue that has been uncovered during OpenZeppelin's latest [collaboration with Compound protocol](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/76).

Having tokens that present a double entry point is a non-trivial pattern that might affect many protocols. This is because it is commonly assumed to have one contract per token. But it was not the case this time :) You can read the entire details of what happened [here](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-tusd-integration-issue-retrospective/).
