## PuzzleWallet 

This one was a bit tricky, but also kind of cool. Like others have mentioned, it is similar to what might be an actual exploit. So it feels like actually hacking something. 

I did have to review a number of sources to come up with the solution though. So I might need more time on this one to get it set in my head.
